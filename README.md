Project 2.0=> Main Page In this I have added->


The API link for the dummy API data to be populated in the UI is here.
The application is supposed to be responsive (mobile & tablet view).
Bootstrap is optional to be used.
Other UI/UX frameworks (SaaS,Tailwind, Font-Awesome) are most welcome.

Every application should be considered as a landing page and should contain the following sessions - 
Sample Logo
Navigation Bar (for sections in the same single page)
Blogs Section.
Blog form for a new post from the user.
Footer.

About Effect that I have added... When You Enter any name in contact page and enter first name and last name and press Enter. Then when you refresh page and again enter name in first name and last name then a dropdown come and that name is showing that you come previous time and same in last name.
This is by get and fetch commands in javascript.
